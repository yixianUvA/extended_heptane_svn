/**
 * \file
 * \brief Call context representation.
 * 
 * Classes related to call contexts representation and manipulation.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Contexts are never manipulated as objects, users only have access to
 * pointers to existing Context objects. 
 * Context are created and freed by a ContextTree which represents the tree of
 * contexts stemming from a given Cfg, the tree entry point, and following the cfg
 * call nodes.
 * - Context comparison therefore should be performed at pointer level. 
 * If two Context* are the same, they refer to the same context in the same
 * tree. Intuitively, contexts in distinct trees, as an example the Context* of
 * different programs, always compare to false. Context trees obtained through
 * copy or cloning share their data with the original and therefore can compare
 * their contexts.
 * - BL
 */

/* FIXME: Pointers to Context are solved upon ContextTree unserialisation.
 * Pointers to a Context can only be solved once the corresponding ContextTree
 * has been unserialised. Instead, the first pointer to a Context could
 * initialise the Context using its id using the appropriate constructor.
 * Further references to the same Context, including the ones in the
 * ContextTree, could then be initialised directly with a proper Context* value.
 * However, the unserialisation Handler does not support searching if an id has
 * been registered already or not.

/* FIXME: Contents type is restricted to vector.  Unserialisation process

 */
/* FIXME: Contents must be a pointer for unserialisation purposes.  When reading
 * a list of contexts from a xml file, contexts pointers' value may not be
 * available due to their context tree being read later. The list cells are
 * registered for late pointer resolution (so-called handles in the cfg
 * library). However, the attribute which is unserialised, and registered for
 * pointer resolution, is not the one attached to objects in the end. Instead a
 * clone is created and attached to objects. The clone itself is not registered
 * for pointer resolution and its original is destroyed.  To circumvent this
 * behaviour, the clone and original contents are swapped upon cloning hence
 * ensuring the registration of the clone contents as target for pointer
 * resolution. This also memory leaks due to pointer resolution targetting the
 * destroyed original attribute.
