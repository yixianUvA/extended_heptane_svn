cfglib : A library for CFG manipulation in WCET analysis
======================================================

This work was made at the IRISA research center which aims at a simple
CFG manipulation library usable by various static program analysis.

In this directory you have the library itself (folder `src` and
`include`). For compilation do: 

	modify DESTDIR in file GNUmakefile to specify where the library should be installed
        make && make install
